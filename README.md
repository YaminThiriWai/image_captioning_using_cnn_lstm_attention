# Image Captioning with Self-Attention

This is Midterm Project for Deep Learning Course. This project implements a deep learning model for generating captions for images using the Flickr8k dataset. The model utilizes self-attention mechanisms to improve caption quality.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-captioning.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the provided Python script to load the trained model and generate captions for images:
   ```
   python generate_caption.py --image_path <path_to_image>
   ```
   Replace `<path_to_image>` with the path to the image for which you want to generate a caption.
   
## Results

The model achieves a BLEU-1 score of X and a BLEU-2 score of Y on the test set, indicating its effectiveness in generating accurate captions for images.
